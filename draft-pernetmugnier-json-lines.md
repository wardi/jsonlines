# Internet-Draft Markdown Template
#
# Rename this file from draft-todo-yourname-protocol.md to get started.
# Draft name format is "draft-<yourname>-<workgroup>-<name>.md".
#
# For initial setup, you only need to edit the first block of fields.
# Only "title" needs to be changed; delete "abbrev" if your title is short.
# Any other content can be edited, but be careful not to introduce errors.
# Some fields will be set automatically during setup if they are unchanged.
#
# Don't include "-00" or "-latest" in the filename.
# Labels in the form draft-<yourname>-<workgroup>-<name>-latest are used by
# the tools to refer to the current version; see "docname" for example.
#
# This template uses kramdown-rfc: https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc
# You can replace the entire file if you prefer a different format.
# Change the file extension to match the format (.xml for XML, etc...)
#
